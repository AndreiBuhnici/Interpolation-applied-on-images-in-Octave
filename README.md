# Interpolation-applied-on-images-in-Octave
Different interpolation methods applied on images
- 3 types of interpolation methods : nearest-neighbour, bilinear, bicubic;
- For nearest-neighbour it calculates the nearest pixel for each pixel;
- For bilinear it calculates the 4 surrounding points of each pixel;
- For bicubic find the derivatives of function f for x and y and calculate the resulted pixel;
- By using the interpolations the program can restore some degraded images;
